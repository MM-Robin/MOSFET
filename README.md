MOSFET Circuit

The aim of this exercise is 
  -> To understand the behaviour and parameters of the MOSFET transistor
  -> To find the Id current variation when gate voltage is varied
  -> To find the output resistance of MOSFET when it is in conducting state
    and also calculate the threshold voltage and transconductance coefficient (k).
  -> To graphically depict that the current I1 and I2 in the given current mirror MOSFET is equal.
